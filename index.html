			 <p> A common example of a machine learning algorithm is “speech-to-text translation”. In this use-case, the objective of the algorithm is to take analog human voice and convert it to words in 0a particular language. As more and more human speech data is inputted into the system, the machine learning algorithm is utilized to train the algorithm to become better at differentiating and recognizing words. The rules behind what the machine learning algorithm needs to follow is defined by a human. In this example, the rules for the machine learning algorithm is really dependent upon the rules of the english language. </p>
